## Project title
Foto-Finder by Justin Pyktel

## Motivation
As our class assignment we were to construct a website from scratch that matches a static comp. Which had more going on in the Javascript side compared to our other solo projects.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML, CSS, & JS</b>

## Features
I took full advantage of flex-box to manipulate the page, so that it is more responsive. Using containers to keep everything nice and grouped helped a lot.
--With this app you can:--
-Upload images, that will then store on your local machine
-Search through them by caption or title
-Favorite specific ones, and it will persist on page load

## Challenges/Wins
Of course I would get sick during finals week... That was a challenge, but all in all I think the project finished up rather well. It would have been nice to work with my peers at the same to get more advanced functionality completed.

## Credits
Big thank you to Flex-Box Froggy!!
